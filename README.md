# Homework-4

In this homework project I used the  index.html, style.css, and script.js to create a quiz that asks questions in a multiple choice format, recording a one point score for each correct answer and subtracting five seconds from a 30 second timer for every wrong answer.  I used JavaScript functions to: create a listening ability to buttons on the HTML, populate the HTML with questions, verify chosen answers with correct answers, save final score to local storage if the user wishes, if saving the score is chosen it asks for intials and saves those as well.  Upon finishing the quiz, the user is taken to the high score HTML page which pulls high scores from the local storage and displays them in order of quiz taken, oldest on top.
